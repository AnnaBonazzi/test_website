  <p>Map of europe with timeline moving years or maybe months, if I can make it, and dots showing the position where people died. The map will be embedded here from some other website.<br />
  I'll try to do something similar to <a href='https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/'>mappingpoliceviolence.org/</a>. For each dot on the map, I will show: name, age, gender (all these are ot always available), description of death.<br />Things I need to think about:
  <ul>
    <li>What map tool? I need to try: TableauPublic, National Geographic MapMaker, MapHub (has many icon options), mapme.com </li>
    <li>What color?</li>
    <li>What symbols to show people? It depends on the tool I use. I haven't tested any yet. Having the choice, I am not sure what would be right between dots (neutral, but it's against my point to make people as dots) or tiny human icons (a little more people-like, but it risks looking ridiculous, like toilet icons)</li>
    <li>If I can, group people by family name to show families traveling together</li>
  </ul>

    <p>Here I will show some diagrams about age stats and cause of death, my point being that there is a gruesome number of ways people die, including police hands, AND if this were present in our opinion, immigration policy narratives such as Italy's "the party is over" would not be believed as much.</p>
