<p>This project is based on the data collected by European association <a href="http://www.unitedagainstracism.org/">UNITED for Intercultural Action</a>, wich collected detailed information about migrants found dead on their way to Europe or within European countries. The .cvs file used as a starting point for the project was elaborated by Italian civic-data organization <a href="https://github.com/ondata/the-list">OnData</a></p>, which extrapolated it from a PDF list published by UNITED. </p>
<p>The data of the UNITED list (3,932 records containing data for 34,361 people between 1993 and May 2018) was processed to expand the original information and extrapolate individual details for each person on the list.</p>
<p>The resulting list, <a href=”https://github.com/annabonazzi/annabonazzi.github.io/blob/master/data/refugeesAndMigrants_for_map.tsv”>available here</a>, includes the following information: counts of people by gender, with a difference between adults and children; gender; age; origin; cause of death; description of the event; number of “stolen” years; source of the information; country where the person was found, specific location; latitude and longitude (for geolocation), an annotation of whether the death occurred while crossing a border, and a link to a silhouette-like picture.</p>
<p>The main objective guiding the data processing and visualization choices for this project was that of preserving the humanity of people on the list, which are known to us only as piece of data (we often don’t even have their names). This objective determined three main processing and visualization choices: 1) determining where each person was found; 2) extrapolating and classifying the cause of death from the general description provided; 3) adding details such as the shadow-like pictures and the count of years each of these people could still have lived, to remind the viewer of the humanity of the dots on the map in contrast to the absurdity of their death, which as discussed in the <a href=”/migration_deaths_discussion.html”>Migration Deaths</a> page, is arguably an unnecessary evil of EU migration policies.</p>
