<p>This project was carried out for a Digital Humanities course at the University of California, Los Angeles (Winter 2019, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/annabonazzi8/">Anna Bonazzi</a> - annabonazzi@hotmail.it)</p>    
<p>This project is based on the data collected by European association <a href="http://www.unitedagainstracism.org/">UNITED for Intercultural Action</a>, wich collects detailed information about migrants found dead on their way to Europe or within European countries. The .cvs file used as a starting point for the project was elaborated by Italian civic-data organization <a href="https://github.com/ondata/the-list">OnData</a>, which extrapolated it from a PDF list published by UNITED. </p>
<p>The data of the UNITED list (3,932 records containing data for 34,361 people between 1993 and May 2018) was processed to expand the original information and extrapolate individual details for each person on the list.</p>
<p>The resulting list, <a href="https://github.com/annabonazzi/annabonazzi.github.io/blob/master/data/refugeesAndMigrants_for_map.tsv">available here</a>, includes the following information: counts of people by gender, with a difference between adults and children; gender; age; origin; cause of death; description of the event; number of “stolen” years; source of the information; country where the person was found, specific location; latitude and longitude (for geolocation), an annotation of whether the death occurred while crossing a border, and a link to a silhouette-like picture.</p>
<p>The main objective guiding the data processing and visualization choices for this project was that of preserving the humanity of people on the list, which are known to us only as piece of data (we often don’t even have their names). This objective determined three main processing and visualization choices: 
  <ol><li> <strong>Determining where each person was found</strong></br>Information about the precise location where each person was found (such as "in the Evros river" or "near the Polish border") was extrapolated from the general description through regex-based text processing. In cases where the general description allowed for more than one definition of the body's location, definitions highlighting that the body was found at a border were given first selection priority, as one of the arguments of this project is that the real issue of migration deaths is an issue of borders, not of individual countries (according to migration policy conceptions that treat neighboring countries as discrete and static units with their separate migration-related problems).
    </br>The locations identified with this process were then geocoded through a mix of manual and coded approaches (the vague nature of most locations, such as "off the coast of Bouzedjar beach (DZ)", made it impossible to complete the whole process automatically).
  </br>It is important to note that many of the geocoded locations that were subsequently placed on the map are in fact approximations or guesses: when a location provided was too vague to guarantee the precise identification of the place where the person died (such as "off the coast of Libya"), an educated guess was made on the basis of the location of most other people who did a similar journey or died in nearby locations. Although imprecise, and not completely solid from a scientific point of view, it can be argued that these points have value, in that they help us provide something similar to a burial place for the people involved.</li>
    <li><strong> Extrapolating and classifying the cause of death from the general description provided</strong></br>This part was the most delicate: broadly categorizing people by the way they lost their life seemed problematic, conidering that the project's main objective is to preserve the humanity of these dead. However, it also seemed important to do justice to their stories by giving some sort of visibility to their death, which is ultimately the main reason why this list of people comes to the viewer's attention.</br>Causes of death were categorized through regex-based text processing and displayed in such a way to express the absurdity and the incredible diversity of gruesome way these people had to die, to try and remind the viewer that none of these deaths was necessary or justified.</li>
    <li><strong> Adding details</strong> such as the shadow-like pictures and the count of years each of these people could still have lived, to remind the viewer of the humanity of the dots on the map in contrast to the absurdity of their death, which as discussed in the <a href="/migration_deaths_discussion.html">Migration Deaths</a> page, is arguably an unnecessary tragedy inextricably connected to EU migration policies.
</br>The shadow-like pictures were chosen to give a more human appearance to the records of the people on the list, who were displayed both on an interactive map and in a slideshow that presents their names and what is known of their stories. In choosing the pictures, two criteria were followed: a) the pictures needed to be neutral enough so as to render the image of the shadow-like person without making them cartoonish or silly; b) there had to be at least some variety among the pictures so as not to create the effect that they were all the same. While full personalization was of course impossible, different pictures were selected for men, women, boys, girls, babies, unidentified people (an androginous / neutral looking picture was selected in this case) and groups.
</br>The count of the stolen years was inspired by a <a href="https://guns.periscopic.com/?year=2013">project that graphically represented gun deaths in the U.S</a> where a counter displayed all the years that gun victims could still have lived according to local life expectancy. In our case, records where the age of the deceased person was available were completed with a note on how much longer they could have lived (the number was calculated on the basis of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274514/life-expectancy-in-europe/">average European life expectancy</a> by gender).
