    <p>Between 1993 and April 2018, at least 34,361 migrants died in their attempt to reach Europe, while moving through European countries, or in European immigration camps (data by UNITED for Intercultural Action). According to the Migrant Files project, which combined UNITED data with data from the Fortress Europe blog, the count is at least 30,000 from the year 2000 alone (Heller and Pécoud, 2017). This suggests that total for the last 25 years is probably close to 40,000 people, including migrants, asylum seekers, refugees. These numbers refer to recorded deaths, and given the circumstances in which migrants lose their lives, it is certain that many more went unrecorded, especially those who died at sea or in the Sahara. The magnitude of this death toll raises a question: are these deaths inevitable? The answer offered by several scholars, among others Albahari (2017), Czaika and Hobolth (2016), Zetter (2015), Fargues (2014), is clearly no: these deaths, far from being inevitable consequences of the global migratory phenomenon, are the products of increasingly restrictive European immigration policies, in the context of the identitarian and defensive atmosphere that has been referred to as “Fortress Europe”. </p>

<p>The European Union, together with all other UN members, recognizes the right of people to seek protection or asylum in foreign countries: according to the EU Commission, “Asylum is granted to people fleeing persecution or serious harm in their own country and therefore in need of international protection. Asylum is a fundamental right; granting it is an international obligation, first recognised in the 1951 Geneva Convention on the protection of refugees” (EU Commission). Many of the migrants who lost their life on the way to Europe over the last 25 years had been escaping from internationally recognized crises which often justify receiving asylum of other forms of humanitarian protection. The figure below shows that most migrants found dead came from areas that have the highest refugee populations in the world, including Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, Eritrea, Somalia, Nigeria, Mali, Ethiopia, Senegal, and others (according to UNHCR data as of 2017): </p>

<p>Individuals from most of these countries have a high chance of obtaining asylum abroad, and yet, increasingly restrictive asylum and visa policies make it difficult or impossible for them to physically reach safer countries where they can apply for asylum (Zetter 2015, Heller and Pécoud 2017), a situation confirmed by a 2018 report of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency: “Access to EU Member States’ territory has become more difficult in almost half of the EU Member States covered. Despite a significant drop in newly arriving asylum seekers, in most EU Member States, the management of external and internal borders remained in emergency mode or became stricter.” (EU FRA 2018, p. 4) In other words, while many migrants theoretically deserve international protection, they often do not have a legal or accessible way to actually request it. The concrete process to request asylum or protection is far from straightforward, and wait times for a decision to be reached range from a few months to a few years. The first and highest barrier to an asylum application, however, is the difficulty of reaching a safe country where to apply (in this case, in Europe): individuals in need of international protection need to first leave the country where they are in danger, find the means to reach a safer country, and then apply. Most African, Middle Eastern and Asian citizens, who make up the majority of migrant populations and migration victims, need a visa in order to travel to a European country legally. Although the Schengen Agreement introduced shared rules for granting visas to non-EU citizens, European countries retain a certain degree of flexibility in setting visa requirements and fulfilment criteria (Czaika and Hobolth 2016). Obtaining a visa has become increasingly difficult for citizens of countries that are considered unable to provide satisfactory security standards, even though this is precisely one of the reasons why citizens try to leave. Zetter (2015) explains this phenomenon as a negative feedback loop: citizens from countries considered unsafe or unable to provide guarantees regarding the safety and identity of their citizens are assigned a “terror identity” (p. 108) that strongly damages their chances to receive a visa and makes it close to impossible for them to travel legally. Several European have also been increasingly criminalizing actions in aid of migrants, as well as redefining and narrowing their criteria to grant humanitarian protection (HRW World Report 2018). Zeller (2015) adds: “Europe offers increasingly less humanitarian protection, and family reunifications have become more difficult. Stricter visa conditions, the criminalization of aiding refugees, and stronger pass and border controls do the rest” (Zetter 2015, p. 180, transl.).</p>

<p>The scarcity of legal pathways to requesting international protection is a major driver for the choice to seek illegal ways to flee abroad. Many migrants, in the absence of other options, embark in dangerous, expensive, and illegal journeys with smugglers, which are connected to the increasing number of people found dead along inner and outer European borders in the past 25 years. Often, these journeys are the product of an institutional paradox where migrants are mostly allowed to stay in Europe, but not to enter. For example, Fargues (2014, p. 3) shows that 86.7 % of Syrian asylum seekers received a positive decision in 2011-13, but almost half of them had to reach their European destination illegally. Similarly, Zetter (2015, p. 71) reports that in the first six months of 2015, about 102,000 unauthorized migrants travelled to Greece and Italy across the Mediterranean, and yet at least 75% of them were from countries in clear need of international protection, such as Syria, Eritrea, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Nigeria, Mali. There is an evident connection between the absence of legal pathways to requesting protection and the number of deaths during illegal migration: citizens of the countries mentioned by Zetter make up the majority of migration deaths of 2015.</p>

<p>Another key factor in the rise of the death toll is what Albahari (2017) calls the “militarization of the border” (p. 10), i.e. coercitive military action against a perceived invasion threat accompanied by a war-like public narrative.  For instance, Albahari (2017) and Ferraretto et al (2018) mention the southern Spanish border at the Strait of Gibraltar and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla on the Moroccan coast. Spain controls its border with an almost 20-feet high double barbed wire fence, a buffer zone, and high-tech patrolling tools. Migration death map data show that at least 208 migrants died in this area (without considering all the people found dead at sea between Spain and Morocco), highlighting the impact of this border fortification policy. The impact of restrictive policies is particularly visible in Europe’s Mediterranean borders: like in Spain, a connection between migration policies and a higher death toll can be seen in Italy, where a restriction of immigration policies led to less involvement in rescue operations. As described by Albahari (2017, p. 10), Italy’s southern borders have been traditionally patrolled by the Italian coast guard and navy, which in fact have also been very active in rescue operations. In November 2014, due to increased pressure from several EU states to further control migrant arrivals, EU border security agency Frontex introduced border patrol Operation Triton with Italy’s direction and the voluntary collaboration of other EU states. This operation, with lower funding and a narrower scope than previous ones, restricted the patrolling area to about 30 miles from the Italian coast and had an immediate impact on the effectiveness of rescue operations (Zetter 2015, p. 111; Heller and  Pécoud, p. 82). As shown by the chart below, the death toll of migrants increased dramatically as a consequence of this new policy:</p>

<p>Policies of this type have often been introduced in Europe in recent times as a reaction to the so-called migration crisis. As Zetter (2015) points out, however, increased rigidity and closure in the face of a perceived threat stem primarily from internal conflicts among EU countries, which failed to fully achieve the harmonization of social and economic policies that was one of the EU’s foundational ideals. In this perspective, the migration crisis can be regarded as an effect, more than a cause, of these new tendencies, as it exposes the weaknesses of the European system in the face of new global phenomena. The feeling of invasion or crisis perceived by many in the EU does not really seem to correspond to current migration flows. In spite of this, Europe’s general approach to managing immigration in the context of shared EU regulations and international human right law has been to a great extent defensive and bureaucratic, with the primary goal of blocking or relocating undesired newcomers  (Zetter 2015, Heller and Pécoud 2017). Zetter (2015)  highlights how this law-and-order approach is not sufficiently focused on the humanitarian side of migration issues: “We are sacrificing the value of protection to the interests of immigration control” (Zetter 2015, p. 91)
This approach, as mentioned above, creates a negative feedback loop that both produces and amplifies situations of illegal migration. In particular, Czaika and Hobolth (2016) have explored the “deflection into irregularity” effect of restrictive visa and asylum policies. They examined a dataset of apprehensions of irregular migrants at the borders of 29 EU countries between 2008 and 2011 and compared them with UNHCR data on asylum and visa request refusals by nationality. They found that there is a correlation between increased visa refusals and increased illegal migration: “An increase in rejected asylum applicants by 10% turn –on average – into an approximately 3% to 4% increase in the total number of (apprehended) irregular migrants [...] An increase in visa refusals by 10% lead, ceteris paribus, to a 5% to 7% increase in apprehension at the border”.  (Czaika and Hobolth 2016, p. 357)</p>

<p>This increase in illegality, which in a way is an artificial one, leads to the criminalization of migrants in general and to an increased feeling of public threat that justifies the use of force (Albahari 2017). One of the most visible effects of this phenomenon is how immigrants often tend to be treated like criminals by law enforcement officers. According to UNITED data, death at the hands of the police or other officers is the eighth cause of death for migrants, and the first among man-induced causes (excluding suicide, the seventh cause of death). More migrants were killed by the police than the sum of migrants killed by smugglers, by racist attacks, by arson attacks against refugee camps, and migrants killed after they were repatriated into the country they previously escaped because they were in danger (for a total of at least 295 confirmed police killings, half of which in the past 10 years). This number, while lower than other causes of death more present in the collective imaginary (such as drowning or starving), is quite telling, as it shows how the migrant is being increasingly constructed as a criminal figure.</p>

<p>It has been widely established that the media play a crucial role in the creation of this identity (Ferraretto et al 2018, Thorbjørnsrud 2015., Beyer and Matthes 2015, Weber 2014).  Ferraretto et al 2018 highlight how the construction of the migrant as a threat, which is instrumental to justify a strong defensive approach, is founded on a lack of adequate historic and geo-political characterization of migration phenomena.
As pointed out by to Thorbjørnsrud (2015), the representation of migrant figures in public media plays a key role in the creation of public opinion on the matter. With a study of migration coverage by media in France, Norway and the US, she identifies two main “frames” through which the figure of the migrant appears to the public: the law-and-order frame, which tends to create the feeling of threat and emergency in connection to migrants, and the humanitarian frame, which “portrays immigrants as victims of an unfair system” (Thorbjørnsrud 2014, p. 774). Ferraretto et al (2018) identify two further narratives: the spectacularization of sporadic migration incidents or related crimes and the figure of the victim of immigration: an outsider’s look on immigration.
The representation of migrants in media is inherently political: the opinions of public political figures, as conveyed and shaped by the media, significantly influence public attitude and perception of immigration, which in turn support more restrictive political actions. (Thorbjørnsrud 2015, p. 775).
This polarized and decontextualized coverage, however, leads to a superficial understanding of the issue that serves political interests but not humanitarian needs. A narrative which frames migrants as  “fake asylum seekers”, “irregular job seekers”, “economic migrants” (implying the assumption that economic migrants have no right to protection), “over stayers”, “illegals” (Thorbjørnsrud 2015, Zetter 2015, Beyer and Matthes 2015) obscures the complexity of migration issues and potential necessary solutions, while supporting oversimplified and restrictive policies that do not address the problem in its complexity.</p>
