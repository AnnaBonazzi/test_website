  <p>Here I'll have some scholarship. I need to think about this more. I think I should have newspaper links showing:
  <ol>
    <li>what is the narrative that I am trying to criticize;</li>
    <li>some links to current rules;</li>
    <li>Some discussion of scholarship about "datification" issue and issue of representation/who has a voice?</li>
  </ol>
