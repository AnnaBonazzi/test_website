# <strong><a href="https://annabonazzi.github.io/migration_deaths_about.html">Migrant Deaths: Project Website</a></strong>


This project is dedicated to migrants who were found dead on their way to Europe or died within European countries between 1993 and 2018. The project's data, maps, and visualizations are based on data collected by European association <a href="http://www.unitedagainstracism.org/">UNITED for Intercultural Action</a>, which collects detailed information about migrants found dead on their way to Europe or within European countries. The .cvs file used as a starting point for the project was elaborated by Italian civic-data organization <a href="https://github.com/ondata/the-list">OnData</a>, which extrapolated it from a PDF list published by UNITED. 

# Project files
<a href="/data">Data</a> - Two csv files with data processed for mapping and visualization. Data: counts of people by gender, with a difference between adults and children; gender; age; origin; cause of death; description of the event; number of “stolen” years; source of the information; country where the person was found, specific location; latitude and longitude (for geolocation), an annotation of whether the death occurred while crossing a border; and a link to a silhouette-like picture.

<a href="/silhouettes">Silhouettes</a> - Images chosen to represent migrant profiles. Images for men, women, boys, girls, babies, groups, and unidentified persons (an androginous / neutral looking picture was selected in this case).
